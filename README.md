# Barcode generator from csv file for the biology inventory system

- generates list of UUID -> ID as a json dictionary inside the inv folder
- generates one large pdf of all the barcodes inside export folder
- maybe ill add argparse and make it better but for now, run it as a script with the csv file as the ony arguement
- to install the python requirements, install from requirements.txt
